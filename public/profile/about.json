    "about": "Hello Everyone!\n\nI am Song Ling from Hong Kong, graduated from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and was awarded a Bachelor degree of Computer Science.\nI have worked as a web developer for the past 4 years on projects ranging from small web applications to large-scale platforms. I love solving problems, especially those related to software development. My favorite part about working as a web developer is that it allows me to be creative with my work and creates opportunities for me to learn new things every day.\nOn the front-end side, I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks such as React and Next.js. I’m passionate about creating intuitive user interfaces that provide an exceptional user experience. I pay great attention to detail, ensuring that the websites or applications I develop are responsive, visually appealing, and accessible across different devices and browsers.\nMoving to the back end, I’m proficient in server-side languages like Node.js and Django. I have extensive experience working with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, and I can design efficient database structures and write optimized queries. I’m familiar with RESTful APIs and know how to integrate them into applications to enable seamless communication between the front end and back end.\nNow I am learning Artificial intelligence."
